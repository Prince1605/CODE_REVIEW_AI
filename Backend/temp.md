❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){return a+b; }
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ `a` and `b` are not defined within the function's scope. This will lead to an error or rely on global variables,
which is bad practice.
* ❌ The function doesn't accept any arguments. A sum function should ideally take the numbers it needs to add as
arguments.
* ❌ Lack of clear documentation or comments explaining the function's purpose.

✅ Recommended Fix:
```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔ Takes `a` and `b` as arguments, making the function self-contained and predictable.
* ✔ Returns the sum of `a` and `b`.

Further Considerations:
* **Error Handling:** You might want to add checks to ensure `a` and `b` are numbers. You could throw an error if they
are not.
* **More Arguments:** Consider using rest parameters (`...numbers`) if you want to create a sum function that can accept
an arbitrary number of arguments.

Example with error handling:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
throw new Error("Both arguments must be numbers.");
}
return a + b;
}
```
